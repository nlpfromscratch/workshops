This is the git repo for the files for the [NLP from scratch](https://www.nlpfromscratch.com) "Analyzing Digital Analytics Data with Generative AI" workshop presented at the 1st Toronto MeasureCamp Unconference on Saturday, October 5th, 2024.

## Description

**Talk Abstract:**  
In this hands-on technical session, we will walk through setting up JupyterAI to allow using GenAI models for coding assistance locally. 

To demonstrate, we will analyze digital analytics data exported from a common platform using python and show that with the help of generative AI, even non-technical practitioners can analyze large datasets locally with minimal coding knowledge.

**What You'll Learn:**  
- Working with Jupyter & Jupyter AI to do AI-assisted coding and analysis
- Using the Ollama framework to serve local models

## Dependencies

The notebook is intended to be run locally. It is recommended to set up a `conda` environment or a separate `venv`, after which you should install the Jupyter AI package:

Windows 🪟:
```bash
python -m venv jupyter-ai
.\jupyterai\Scripts\activate
pip install jupyter-ai
jupyter lab
```

Mac 🍎 / Linux 🐧:
```bash
python -m venv jupyter-ai
source jupyter-ai/bin/activate
pip install jupyter-ai
jupyter lab
```
